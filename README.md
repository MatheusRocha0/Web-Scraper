# Web Scraper
![Image](web-scraping.jpeg)

In this project, I created a solution for Book Club (fictional company), a start up that has a book store platform. A user may buy, sell or trade books with other users.

To make the traffic in the platform higher, I was hired by their CEO to create a Recommendation Engine. But there is one problem, they do not have any data stored. So, my first task is use Web Scraping technologies to collect data (Book title, price and rating) from their site, generate a useful file from it and also store the data into a database.

DISCLAIMER: The site is the books.toscrape.com. This site was developed for data scientists to test their knowledge on Web Scraping. So, there is no any problem scraping them.

The script I wrote scrapes data from their site, generate a CSV file and also store the data into SQLite3 database. Make yourself at home to use this solution for your personal work. Just follow the steps and you will know how to do it.
